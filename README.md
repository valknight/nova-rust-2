NB: This is a fork of a fork. Specifically, this fork's [Chris Krycho's](https://github.com/chriskrycho/nova-rust-2) repository. I've forked, as that repository seems relatively unmaintained, and contains a critical regression that prevented the extension from functioning.

Notable changes:
- Contains fix to ensure `rust-analyzer` is correctly installed

I've also removed references to AI tooling in the repo (e.g. CLAUDE.md) - just out of concern of these tools causing regressions.

# Rust Extension for the Nova Text Editor

This project brings [Rust Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) support to the [Nova text editor](https://nova.app/) (macOS only). It is written in TypeScript for static typing, but transpiled to run in the macOS JavaScript environment using [Nova's API](https://docs.nova.app/) for extensions. This extension provides Rust developers with syntax highlighting, assistance from the Rust Analyzer language server, error checking, and automatic formatting.

This particular extension is a descendant of [the original Nova Rust extension][nr1] created by [Drew Kilb][dk]!
